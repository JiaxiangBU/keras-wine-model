everyday price. It's a blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah.\n","Predicted:  10.488673 Actual:  12.0 \n","\n","This lavishly oaked, opaque Zinfandel sports a dense nose of blackberry with pronounced toasty and menthol shadings. The mouthfeel is full and smooth, there's dark fruit and plenty of espresso, bitter chocolate and tar on the palate and finish, with tannins to lose on the back end. The wine may open up and the fruit ascend more in a year; lovers of heavy toast can eagerly drink it up now.\n","Predicted:  12.631305 Actual:  18.0 \n","\n","Dry and oaky, this Chardonnay offers herb-inflected pineapple and pear flavors.\n","Predicted:  25.0863 Actual:  60.0 \n","\n","Pretty rustic even for a Petite Sirah, with big, edgy tannins and a scoury mouthfeel. But it shows rich flavors of cherries, berries, cola, bacon and sandalwood, with a spicy, peppery finish. Ready to drink now.\n","Predicted:  29.00429 Actual:  28.0 \n","\n","This is for acid lovers only. Tart almost to the point of sourness, it is saved by its sharply etched green apple crispness. Definitely a Sauvignon Blanc in the style of a piercing Quincy, with that sort of acidity, but not the minerality.\n","Predicted:  17.432402 Actual:  13.0 \n","\n","Herbal wine, its fruits laced with flavors of lavender and thyme. This second wine of Château Coussin is immediately attractive while also having a fine edge of texture.\n","Predicted:  23.953983 Actual:  16.0 \n","\n","Sometimes you just need a cheap, quaffable, crisp dry white wine to drink in copious amounts, and this one will do just fine, thank you. It's citrusy, spicy, and dry, and has enough acid to cleanse the palate.\n","Predicted:  9.448648 Actual:  8.0 \n","\n","This cold-climate vineyard is source to some of the most powerful Chardonnays in California. The '05 shows the massive tropical mango, guava, nectarine, apricot and pineapple flavors the vineyard effortlessly delivers. Almost over the top, it's saved by very crisp acidity.\n","Predicted:  43.208466 Actual:  45.0 \n","\n","Bright and spicy and loaded with great, clean, pure fruit flavors. This is exemplary for the '06 vintage; a wine of lovely purity and focus. Fresh and very spicy, quite bright and loaded with mixed strawberries, plums, tropical and even stone fruits. Definitely the biggest and most complete Two Blondes bottling to date.\n","Predicted:  44.454628 Actual:  45.0 \n","\n","A yeasty and buttery sparkler with banana, yellow rose, walnut, bread crust and a sharp point of minerality. Fruit flavors of Golden Delicious apple roll over the palate, followed by crisp acidity. Imported by Wine Emporium.\n","Predicted:  27.496204 Actual:  28.0 \n","\n","A wonderfully drinkable Syrah, dry and balanced, with tart plum, blackberry and coffee flavors and a deeper undertow of rich earth. The tannins are sizable, but smooth. Has lots of class.\n","Predicted:  43.169464 Actual:  31.0 \n","\n","Made in the softly ripe, oaky style, this Chard shows flavors of pineapple cream, lemon zest, vanilla custard and cinnamon spice. It's a crowd pleaser.\n","Predicted:  28.733345 Actual:  30.0 \n","\n","Leaner and earthier than many Chardonnays, with notes of green and dried herbs alongside the citrus and tropical fruits. Oak plays a modest role. All in all, this discrete wine is best enjoyed now.\n","Predicted:  39.868435 Actual:  40.0 \n","\n","Coonawarra is supposed to be Cabernet country, but Shiraz can do well there too. This is a full-bodied, rich wine that manages to be hugely concentrated yet not overly heavy. Leathery, meaty, bacony notes are layered over plummy fruit, while berry notes emerge on the finish, dusted in coffee and cocoa. Drink now–2020.\n","Predicted:  54.232475 Actual:  65.0 \n","\n","There's an odd plastic note here. Firm and compact, with unyielding fruit; black cherry, leaf and black tea flavors dominate. This seems closed down even after being open for several hours.\n","Predicted:  48.53077 Actual:  50.0 \n","\n","A vegetal wine dealing rhubarb flavors along with mint and leather on the nose. It has high acidity but just enough sweetness to hold it.\n","Predicted:  28.189388 Actual:  28.0 \n","\n","This is a very attractive ruby-colored wine from the Adriatic Coast of Italy that delivers fresh notes of blackberry, cherry, spice, tobacco and leather. The wine is very rich and velvety in the mouth, but remains contained and elegant at the same time.\n","Predicted:  12.087196 Actual:  17.0 \n","\n","A genuine expression of Nebbiolo, this has subdued aromas of dried fruit, cola and cherry. The tannins show fine texture and a long, silky quality.\n","Predicted:  29.728271 Actual:  57.0 \n","\n","The plum and peppery spice nose of this Bordeaux-style red blend leads into approachable flavors of plum, vanilla oak and currants. The wine offers elegant tannins and a smooth finish.\n","Predicted:  30.78965 Actual:  22.0 \n","\n","This is a brand-new bottling from Merry Edwards. It's her first from Westside Road, which is warmer than her haunting grounds around the southern part of the valley. It's quite a promising debut. The wine is round, soft, charming and complex, with elaborate cherry, blackberry, licorice and cola flavors. It feels important and ageworthy. Drink now, with several hours of decanting, or cellar through 2020.\n","Predicted:  89.32313 Actual:  54.0 \n","\n","A great followup to the '08, which was one of the best Gewürztraminers of the vintage. The '09 is even better, with a crisp, minerally mouthfeel, and superrich flavors of tropical fruits, spices and honeysuckle flowers. No oak, no malolactic and just a slight touch of sweetness on the finish.\n","Predicted:  19.18605 Actual:  25.0 \n","\n","Tight and aromatically intense, this delivers layers of ripe fruit, prune, black pepper, blackberry jelly and cinnamon. Those beautiful tones are followed by soft, velvety tannins.\n","Predicted:  46.552937 Actual:  16.0 \n","\n","Smells inviting, with grass, gooseberry, pine cone, smoky and vanilla aromas, and drinks dry and clean, with citrus and fig flavors. There's a tiny hit of honey on the long, spicy finish. Really a nice sipper.\n","Predicted:  8.942509 Actual:  10.0 \n","\n","This is jammy and reduced throughout, especially on the nose, which offers a dense blueberry aroma. Saturated and solid on the palate, it features ripe flavors of black plum, blackberry and caramel. A potent, fruity, modern type of Tempranillo that's long on fruit and short on complexity.\n","Predicted:  28.428833 Actual:  23.0 \n","\n","An intensely herbal wine, smelling of the garrigue where it is grown. It is lean, firmly tannic with high red fruit acids, and a dry structure. It's rustic, reminiscent of old-style winemaking.\n","Predicted:  20.1695 Actual:  14.0 \n","\n","Crustacés means shellfish. Does the wine go with shellfish? Yes, with its fine, light, just steely acidity, a perfumed character and its bright, clean finish.\n","Predicted:  17.518122 Actual:  12.0 \n","\n","Soft and creamy, this is consistent with the previous vintage and sets the stage for the winery's bigger, oakier single-vineyard Chardonnays. Mixed stone fruits, pineapple and an elegant, full-bodied mouthfeel make this particularly appealing for the price. It uses the oak judiciously, and avoids the overdone vanilla flavors that many inexpensive New World Chardonnays rely on.\n","Predicted:  14.800986 Actual:  13.0 \n","\n","A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.\n","Predicted:  47.004665 Actual:  48.0 \n","\n","Attractive fruits with a good, juicy flavor characterize this easy, fresh wine. Black berry flavors and vivid acidity make it ready to drink now.\n","Predicted:  9.556298 Actual:  10.0 \n","\n","Medium-intense aromas of lingonberry, cherry and legume mark the nose. As the wine progresses across the palate, the acidity subjugates the fruit, and the palate turns tart.\n","Predicted:  14.496183 Actual:  17.0 \n","\n","A common but drinkable Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with a rough mouthfeel framing cherry and herb flavors. From Testarossa.\n","Predicted:  20.732632 Actual:  20.0 \n","\n","With lots of acidity and seemingly sweet lime, pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc has a sweet-sour taste, like Life Savers candy.\n","Predicted:  9.414493 Actual:  14.0 \n","\n","Coconut is the lead aroma, but there's graphite, cool earth, cola, blackberry and raw oak on the bouquet. Feels structured and lush, with tight tannins and robust flavors of clove, coconut, blackberry and tobacco. Quite oaky late, with barrel-driven flavors driving the finish.\n","Predicted:  23.43571 Actual:  19.0 \n","\n","Done in a dry style, this fine effort is sourced from the Wallula Benches vineyard. It's good juice, with a delicious mix of stone fruits, citrus zest and a hint of sweet honey.\n","Predicted:  28.958557 Actual:  12.0 \n","\n","A powerful wine with forceful minerality. Still, it's loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapple/mango category. Finishes crisp but precise, with notes of wet stone and lingering nips of green apple and peach.\n","Predicted:  20.172092 Actual:  17.0 \n","\n","A step up from the 2006 vintage, rich and smooth, very perfumed. The tannins are soft, balancing well with the acidity, layer of wood spice and the ebullient red berry fruits.\n","Predicted:  31.520094 Actual:  30.0 \n","\n","Rustic, soft and simple, with  jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. Contains almost a quarter of Petite Sirah, but it's still a gentle, medium-bodied wine.\n","Predicted:  11.43503 Actual:  12.0 \n","\n","This has dark, hearty fruit that is framed mostly around a taste of dried cherry. It's a bit one-dimensional, finishing with a burst of leather.\n","Predicted:  23.435814 Actual:  22.0 \n","\n","Big and bulky, this is concentrated and intense, with plenty of weight and texture to go along with dark flavors of blackberry, black olive and chocolate. A touch of mint helps lighten it a little, and the dusty tannins help frame the powerful fruit. Try after 2017.\n","Predicted:  76.80589 Actual:  75.0 \n","\n","While the wood aromas dominate, on the palate, there is a much richer, rounder character. This wine, with its huge fruit, white peach flavors, layers of wood and citrus, is just waiting to burst out of its youth. Delicious ripeness and acidity lend balance, while the oak needs some time to calm down and mature.\n","Predicted:  158.10744 Actual:  198.0 \n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uFnTjrJMFBo5","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"d69a2f61-99cf-44ee-bfd8-aefcb6595255","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573571455529,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":705,"user":{"displayName":"李家翔","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBhv8_oPNlk5Bo7JXpPSYuOPtNYwAxQ4T7eM0UbcQ=s64","userId":"12569673191273684308"}}},"source":["# Compare the average difference between actual price and the model's predicted price\n","print('Average prediction difference: ', diff / num_predictions)"],"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Average prediction difference:  7.428834748268128\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1TEW7wP2LHO0","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from sklearn.metrics import r2_score"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Bi9kUj2ILRFc","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"5c021f0a-5ab7-4b70-b94f-a9798d7648a1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1573571610937,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":661,"user":{"displayName":"李家翔","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBhv8_oPNlk5Bo7JXpPSYuOPtNYwAxQ4T7eM0UbcQ=s64","userId":"12569673191273684308"}}},"source":["r2_score(labels_test, predictions)"],"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.5615770185633517"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":26}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jMWGKwndLga7","colab_type":"text"},"source":["R^2 没有特别高。"]}]}
